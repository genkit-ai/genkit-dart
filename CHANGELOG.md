## 0.9.0

- Made `fromResponse` and `fromStreamChunk` optional in `defineRemoteAction`. If not provided, the response and stream chunks will be `dynamic` objects decoded from JSON, instead of requiring a typed conversion function.

## 0.8.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `.stream()` method now returns an `ActionStream` instead of a `FlowStreamResponse` record. `ActionStream` is a `Stream` that provides two ways to access the flow's final, non-streamed response:
  - `onResult`: A `Future` that completes with the result. This is the recommended approach. It will complete with a `GenkitException` if the stream terminates with an error or is cancelled. 
  - `result`: A synchronous getter that should only be used after the stream is fully consumed. It will throw a `GenkitException` if the stream is not consumed, terminates with an error or is cancelled. 

  **Migration**:
  Code that previously looked like this:
  ```dart
  final (:stream, :response) = myAction.stream(input: ...);
  await for (final chunk in stream) {
    // ...
  }
  final finalResult = await response;
  ```

  Should be updated to use `onResult`:
  ```dart
  final stream = myAction.stream(input: ...);
  await for (final chunk in stream) {
    // ...
  }
  final finalResult = await stream.onResult;
  // or
  final finalResult = stream.result;
  ```

## 0.7.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The package has been renamed from `package:genkit/genkit.dart` to `package:genkit/client.dart`. You will need to update your import statements.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `response` future returned by the `.stream()` method is now nullable (`Future<O?>`). This change supports improved error handling and cancellation.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Errors occurring on the server during a stream are now thrown by the `stream` itself. This allows you to catch exceptions directly within a `try/catch` block surrounding an `await for` loop.

## 0.6.0

- Added standard Genkit data classes for working with generative models, including `GenerateResponse`, `Message`, and `Part` types.
- Added helper getters like `.text` and `.media` for easier data extraction.
